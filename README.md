# Tech Portfolio

A personal portfolio website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). It features a landing page, an interactive resume, and a contact form with links to LinkedIn, GitHub, and email.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

## Running Locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the site. The application will automatically reload as you edit the source files.

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Usage Notes

- Use the navigation bar to access the Home, Resume, and Contact pages.
- Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS with custom colors defined in `tailwind.config.ts`.
- The site is written in TypeScript and leverages the Next.js App Router.
